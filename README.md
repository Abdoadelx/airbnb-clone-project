# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application that simulates a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security, while teaching modern software development workflows.

## Goals
- Learn collaborative team workflows with Git & GitHub.
- Understand backend architecture and database design.
- Build secure APIs (authentication, authorization, validation).
- Practice CI/CD pipelines for reliable deployment.
- Plan and document complex software projects clearly.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API**: REST + GraphQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD & Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Docker (planned)

## Team Roles

In the Airbnb Clone Project, each team member has a specific role to ensure smooth collaboration and progress. The main roles include:

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. Implements APIs, handles authentication, authorization, and ensures system scalability and performance.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database structure. Ensures data integrity, optimization of queries, backups, and overall database security.

### 3. Frontend Developer
Focuses on creating the user interface and user experience. Works closely with backend developers to integrate APIs and ensure smooth interaction between client and server.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, automation, and monitoring of the project. Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containers (e.g., Docker), and ensures reliable system performance in production.

### 5. Security Engineer
Implements security best practices. Protects APIs from vulnerabilities, manages data privacy, and ensures compliance with security standards.

### 6. Project Manager
Coordinates the team, plans tasks, tracks progress, and ensures that deadlines and project goals are met. Acts as the communication bridge between stakeholders and developers.

### 7. QA Engineer (Tester)
Responsible for testing the application to ensure quality and reliability. Writes automated/manual tests and verifies that new features work correctly without breaking existing functionality.
