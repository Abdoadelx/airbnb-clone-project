# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application that simulates a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security, while teaching modern software development workflows.

## Goals
- Learn collaborative team workflows with Git & GitHub.
- Understand backend architecture and database design.
- Build secure APIs (authentication, authorization, validation).
- Practice CI/CD pipelines for reliable deployment.
- Plan and document complex software projects clearly.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API**: REST + GraphQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD & Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Docker (planned)

## Team Roles

In the Airbnb Clone Project, each team member has a specific role to ensure smooth collaboration and progress. The main roles include:

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. Implements APIs, handles authentication, authorization, and ensures system scalability and performance.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database structure. Ensures data integrity, optimization of queries, backups, and overall database security.

### 3. Frontend Developer
Focuses on creating the user interface and user experience. Works closely with backend developers to integrate APIs and ensure smooth interaction between client and server.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, automation, and monitoring of the project. Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containers (e.g., Docker), and ensures reliable system performance in production.

### 5. Security Engineer
Implements security best practices. Protects APIs from vulnerabilities, manages data privacy, and ensures compliance with security standards.

### 6. Project Manager
Coordinates the team, plans tasks, tracks progress, and ensures that deadlines and project goals are met. Acts as the communication bridge between stakeholders and developers.

### 7. QA Engineer (Tester)
Responsible for testing the application to ensure quality and reliability. Writes automated/manual tests and verifies that new features work correctly without breaking existing functionality.

## Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a modern full-stack technology ecosystem to deliver a scalable and secure application:

- **Django**: A Python-based web framework for rapid backend development. It will be used to build RESTful APIs, handle user authentication, and manage business logic.
- **MySQL**: A relational database for storing application data such as users, bookings, and properties. It ensures consistency and supports complex queries.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaborative team workflows.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and ensure consistent environments across development and production.
- **CI/CD Tools (GitHub Actions)**: Automates testing, integration, and deployment of new features.

## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone will include the following key entities:

- **Users**
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - Relationship: A user can create multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

- **Properties**
  - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `owner_id`
  - Relationship: Each property belongs to a user (owner). A property can have many bookings and reviews.

- **Bookings**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `status`
  - Relationship: Each booking belongs to one user and one property.

- **Reviews**
  - Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  - Relationship: A review is made by a user for a property.

- **Payments**
  - Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`
  - Relationship: Each payment is tied to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

The core features of the Airbnb Clone Project include:

- **User Management**
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Ensures secure authentication and role-based access (e.g., host vs. guest).

- **Property Management**
  Hosts can list, update, and delete their properties. Includes property details such as location, pricing, and availability.

- **Booking System**
  Guests can search properties and make reservations. Supports date selection, booking confirmation, and status tracking.

- **Reviews and Ratings**
  Guests can leave reviews for properties they have stayed at. Helps build trust and reliability in the platform.

- **Payment Integration**
  Allows guests to pay securely for bookings. Supports transaction tracking and error handling for failed payments.

- **Search and Filtering**
  Provides property search by location, price range, and availability. Enhances user experience in finding suitable listings.

## API Security

Security is critical in protecting user data and ensuring safe transactions. The project will implement:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must log in with valid credentials (JWT tokens). Prevents unauthorized access to APIs.

- **Authorization**  
  Ensures that only authorized users (e.g., property owners) can update or delete listings. Protects resources from misuse.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Prevents abuse by limiting the number of API requests per user within a time frame. Protects against denial-of-service attacks.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  Ensures all data coming into the system is valid and secure. Protects against SQL injection and XSS attacks.

- **Secure Payments**  
  Payment information will be encrypted and handled according to industry standards (PCI-DSS). Protects sensitive financial data.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** ensures rapid and reliable delivery of new features:

- **Continuous Integration**: Every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main branch. This prevents bugs from reaching production.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Code changes are automatically deployed to staging or production environments after passing tests.

**Tools**:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Docker**: Provides consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **(Optional: Kubernetes/AWS)**: Can be used for scaling in production.

This pipeline improves development speed, reduces manual errors, and ensures consistent quality across environments.
